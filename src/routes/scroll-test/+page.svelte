        Limp, the body of Gorrister hung from the pink palette; unsupported—hanging
        high above us in the computer chamber; and it did not shiver in the chill, oily breeze
        that blew eternally through the main cavern. The body hung head down, attached to
        the underside of the palette by the sole of its right foot. It had been drained of blood
        through a precise incision made from ear to ear under the lantern jaw. There was no
        blood on the reflective surface of the metal floor.
        When Gorrister joined our group and looked up at himself, it was already too
        late for us to realize that, once again, AM had duped us, had had its fun; it had been a
        diversion on the part of the machine. Three of us had vomited, turning away from
        one another in a reflex as ancient as the nausea that had produced it.
        Gorrister went white. It was almost as though he had seen a voodoo icon, and
        was afraid of the future. "Oh, God," he mumbled, and walked away. The three of us
        followed him after a time, and found him sitting with his back to one of the smaller
        chittering banks, his head in his hands. Ellen knelt down beside him and stroked his
        hair. He didn't move, but his voice came out of his covered face quite clearly. "Why
        doesn't it just do us in and get it over with? Christ, I don't know how much longer I
        can go on like this."
        It was our one hundred and ninth year in the computer.
        He was speaking for all of us.
        Nimdok (which was the name the machine had forced him to use, because AM
        amused itself with strange sounds) was hallucinating that there were canned goods
        in the ice caverns. Gorrister and I were very dubious. "It's another shuck," I told
        them. "Like the goddam frozen elephant AM sold us. Benny almost went out of his
        mind over that one. We'll hike all that way and it'll be putrified or some damn thing.
        I say forget it. Stay here, it'll have to come up with something pretty soon or we'll
        die."
        Benny shrugged. Three days it had been since we'd last eaten. Worms. Thick,
        ropey.

        Nimdok was no more certain. He knew there was the chance, but he was getting
        thin. It couldn't be any worse there, than here. Colder, but that didn't matter much.
        Hot, cold, hail, lava, boils or locusts—it never mattered: the machine masturbated
        and we had to take it or die.
        Ellen decided us. "I've got to have something, Ted. Maybe there'll be some
        Bartlett pears or peaches. Please, Ted, let's try it."
        I gave in easily. What the hell. Mattered not at all. Ellen was grateful, though.
        She took me twice out of turn. Even that had ceased to matter. And she never came,
        so why bother? But the machine giggled every time we did it. Loud, up there, back
        there, all around us, he snickered. It snickered. Most of the time I thought of AM as
        it, without a soul; but the rest of the time I thought of it as him, in the masculine ...
        the paternal ... the patriarchal ... for he is a jealous people. Him. It. God as Daddy the
        Deranged.
        We left on a Thursday. The machine always kept us up­to­date on the date. The
        passage of time was important; not to us, sure as hell, but to him ... it ... AM.
        Thursday. Thanks.
        Nimdok and Gorrister carried Ellen for a while, their hands locked to their own
        and each other's wrists, a seat. Benny and I walked before and after, just to make
        sure that, if anything happened, it would catch one of us and at least Ellen would be
        safe. Fat chance, safe. Didn't matter.
        It was only a hundred miles or so to the ice caverns, and the second day, when
        we were lying out under the blistering sun­thing he had materialized, he sent down
        some manna. Tasted like boiled boar urine. We ate it.
        On the third day we passed through a valley of obsolescence, filled with rusting
        carcasses of ancient computer banks. AM had been as ruthless with its own life as
        with ours. It was a mark of his personality: it strove for perfection. Whether it was a
        matter of killing off unproductive elements in his own world­filling bulk, or
        perfecting methods for torturing us, AM was as thorough as those who had invented
        him—now long since gone to dust—could ever have hoped.
        There was light filtering down from above, and we realized we must be very near
        the surface. But we didn't try to crawl up to see. There was virtually nothing out
        there; had been nothing that could be considered anything for over a hundred years.
        Only the blasted skin of what had once been the home of billions. Now there were
        only five of us, down here inside, alone with AM.
        I heard Ellen saying frantically, "No, Benny! Don't, come on, Benny, don't
        please!"
        And then I realized I had been hearing Benny murmuring, under his breath, for
        several minutes. He was saying, "I'm gonna get out, I'm gonna get out ..." over and
        over. His monkey­like face was crumbled up in an expression of beatific delight and
        sadness, all at the same time. The radiation scars AM had given him during the
        "festival" were drawn down into a mass of pink­white puckerings, and his features
        seemed to work independently of one another. Perhaps Benny was the luckiest of the
        five of us: he had gone stark, staring mad many years before.
        But even though we could call AM any damned thing we liked, could think the
        foulest thoughts of fused memory banks and corroded base plates, of burnt out
        circuits and shattered control bubbles, the machine would not tolerate our trying to
        escape. Benny leaped away from me as I made a grab for him. He scrambled up the
        face of a smaller memory cube, tilted on its side and filled with rotted components.

        He squatted there for a moment, looking like the chimpanzee AM had intended him
        to resemble.
        Then he leaped high, caught a trailing beam of pitted and corroded metal, and
        went up it, hand­over­hand like an animal, till he was on a girdered ledge, twenty
        feet above us.
        "Oh, Ted, Nimdok, please, help him, get him down before—" She cut off. Tears
        began to stand in her eyes. She moved her hands aimlessly.
        It was too late. None of us wanted to be near him when whatever was going to
        happen, happened. And besides, we all saw through her concern. When AM had
        altered Benny, during the machine's utterly irrational, hysterical phase, it was not
        merely Benny's face the computer had made like a giant ape's. He was big in the
        privates; she loved that! She serviced us, as a matter of course, but she loved it from
        him. Oh Ellen, pedestal Ellen, pristine­pure Ellen; oh Ellen the clean! Scum filth.
        Gorrister slapped her. She slumped down, staring up at poor loonie Benny, and
        she cried. It was her big defense, crying. We had gotten used to it seventy­five years
        earlier. Gorrister kicked her in the side.
        Then the sound began. It was light, that sound. Half sound and half light,
        something that began to glow from Benny's eyes, and pulse with growing loudness,
        dim sonorities that grew more gigantic and brighter as the light/sound increased in
        tempo. It must have been painful, and the pain must have been increasing with the
        boldness of the light, the rising volume of the sound, for Benny began to mewl like a
        wounded animal. At first softly, when the light was dim and the sound was muted,
        then louder as his shoulders hunched together: his back humped, as though he was
        trying to get away from it. His hands folded across his chest like a chipmunk's. His
        head tilted to the side. The sad little monkey­face pinched in anguish. Then he began
        to howl, as the sound coming from his eyes grew louder. Louder and louder. I
        slapped the sides of my head with my hands, but I couldn't shut it out, it cut through
        easily. The pain shivered through my flesh like tinfoil on a tooth.
        And Benny was suddenly pulled erect. On the girder he stood up, jerked to his
        feet like a puppet. The light was now pulsing out of his eyes in two great round
        beams. The sound crawled up and up some incomprehensible scale, and then he fell
        forward, straight down, and hit the plate­steel floor with a crash. He lay there jerking
        spastically as the light flowed around and around him and the sound spiraled up out
        of normal range
